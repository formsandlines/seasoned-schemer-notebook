# “The Seasoned Schemer” Notebook

My personal notebook to work with [The Seasoned Schemer](https://mitpress.mit.edu/9780262561006/the-seasoned-schemer/), using the [Racket](https://racket-lang.org) implementation of Scheme.

Here is my previous notebook for [The Little Schemer](https://github.com/formsandlines/little-schemer-notebook), which I have completed and enjoyed very much.
